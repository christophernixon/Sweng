"""Initial approach will be using simple algorithm: for finding LCA of n1 and n2,
the path from root to n1 and root to n2 will be found and stored in two separate arrays.
Both these arrays will be traversed similtaniously until a node with a differing key is found.
This node will then be returned as the LCA."""
